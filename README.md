## Customization

### Adding New Work Types
To add new work types, modify the `TractorWorkForm` in `app.py`:

```python
work_type = SelectField('Work Type', choices=[
    ('harvesting', 'Harvesting'),
    ('transport', 'Transport'),
    ('rotor', 'Rotor'),
    ('plough', 'Plough'),
    ('seeding', 'Seeding'),
    ('irrigation', 'Irrigation'),
    ('your_new_type', 'Your New Type'),  # Add here
    ('other', 'Other')
], validators=[DataRequired()])
```

### Changing Currency
To change the currency symbol, update the templates where â‚¹ appears:

```html
<!-- Replace â‚¹ with your currency symbol -->
â‚¹{{ "%.2f"|format(work.total_amount) }}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Database not created**: The database is created automatically on first run. If issues occur, delete `tractor_management.db` and restart the application.

2. **Port already in use**: Change the port in `app.py`:
   ```python
   app.run(debug=True, port=5001)
   ```

3. **Dependencies not found**: Ensure you're using the correct Python environment and have installed all requirements.
